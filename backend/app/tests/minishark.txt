I see you're eyeballin' the Minishark.. You really don't want to know how it was made.

— The Arms Dealer
Minishark (demo)
The Minishark shooting Musket Balls

The Minishark is a gun that can be bought from the Arms Dealer for 35 and can use any form of bullet. It is capable of autofiring and each shot has a 1/3 (33.33%) chance of not consuming any ammunition. It has the lowest use time of all pre-Hardmode ranged weapons.

Its best modifier is Demonic, as it does not have any knockback and thus cannot get modifiers that affect it. It can also get the Deadly modifier, which, while the Demonic modifier may provide the greatest damage per hit, grants a higher increase to the overall DPS.

Achievement

Completely Awesome • “Obtain a minishark.”
Obtain the Minishark. 
Category: Collector Collector
Tips
 The Completely Awesome achievement can be unlocked without spending the 35 by buying a Minishark and then reselling it without closing the shop window.
The Minishark deals small amounts of damage at a rapid rate. Against enemies with higher defense, such as bosses, its damage is reduced to 1 per hit, causing a significant decrease in overall damage output. Armor penetration, e.g. via the Shark Tooth Necklace, can help alleviate this shortcoming.
As most Hardmode enemies have enough defense to reduce the Minishark's damage to 1 per hit and have significantly more health, it becomes functionally useless beyond this point and is better replaced by its upgrade, the Megashark.
Similarly to increased armor penetration, bullets that deal higher damage can significantly increase the weapon's DPS.
Even with the 1/3 (33.33%) chance not to consume ammo, the Minishark can still use a large amount of bullets very quickly, especially with modifiers that decrease its use time. However, the ammo-conserving effect of the Minishark can be increased substantially by adding certain gear, e.g. the following:
Gear	Chance not to consume ammo	Avg. yield of
9999 bullets	Avg. ammo consumption rate
(continuous fire)
Individual	Total
n/a (base weapon)	1/3 (33.33%)	14998.5 shots	1 every 0.2 seconds
(12 ticks[1])
Necro armorNecro armor() or Fossil armorFossil armor	1/5 (20%)	7/15 (46.67%)	18748.1 shots	1 every 0.25 seconds
(15 ticks[1])
Ammo BoxAmmo Box	1/5 (20%)	43/75 (57.33%)	23435.2 shots	1 every 0.313 seconds
(18.75 ticks[1])
Trivia
The name is likely a reference to the fictional hand-held Minigun, which has been popularized in video games and films since the 1980s. In practice, a man-portable M134 minigun would be nearly impossible to manage as an individual infantry weapon, and highly impractical for a human being to either carry or operate.
The Minishark's color and design is similar to that of the machine gun from the 1999 multiplayer-focused first-person shooter Quake III Arena. They are also both automatic guns with multiple barrels and low damage per bullet.
The Minishark, along with the Clockwork Assault Rifle, Star Cannon, Flintlock Pistol, are some of the only guns without knockback.
The Minishark is the first of several rapid-firing guns that were named and designed based on a water creature, the others being the Gatligator, Megashark, and S.D.M.G..
The Minishark is implied to be made from a live shark. This is supported by several details:
The Arms Dealer has a chance to say: "I see you're eyeballin' the Minishark. You really don't want to know how it was made.", suggesting it was created from a live shark.
An excerpt from the Arms Dealer's Bestiary entry says, in part, "...guns made from sharks"
5 Shark Fins are required to craft a Megashark.

Footnotes
 A tick is a time unit countable by the software. Most of Terraria's updating logic happens every tick. A tick has the length of 1/60th of a second, hence there are 60 ticks in a second and 3600 ticks in a minute.
