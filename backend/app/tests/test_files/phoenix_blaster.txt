Phoenix Blaster (demo)
Animation of the Phoenix Blaster.

The Phoenix Blaster is a type of gun, and essentially acts as an upgraded Handgun, featuring increased bullet damage and velocity but slightly less knockback than its predecessor. It is third only to the Musket and Star Cannon and tied with the Quad-Barrel Shotgun for base damage among guns available prior to Hardmode, but with more than triple the rate of fire of the Musket. However, it cannot be autofired, apart from on pc.

Its best modifier is Unreal.

Tips
The Phoenix Blaster is useful into early-mid Hardmode, outclassing many early-Hardmode weapons.
The Phoenix Blaster is highly effective against the Wall of Flesh due to its high base damage and fire power.
Trivia
The Phoenix Blaster is modeled after the Colt M1911 pistol.
It appears to have a flashlight/laser "under-barrel" attachment under its barrel, although it is unusable.
Although being made out of Hellstone, the Phoenix Blaster does not have any attacks nor stats related to flames.
